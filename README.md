## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to predict multiple diseases, including **Heart disease** and **Diabetes**, using machine learning models. By leveraging various ML algorithms, we analyze patient data and provide accurate predictions based on key health indicators.

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
🔹 **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
🔹 **Libraries:** Pandas 📊, NumPy 🔢, Scikit-learn 🤖, Streamlit 🎨 (for UI)  
🔹 **Dataset:** Publicly available health datasets 📂  

## ✨ Features  
✅ Predicts the likelihood of heart disease ❤️ and diabetes 🩸  
✅ User-friendly **Streamlit UI** for easy input and visualization  
✅ Supports **multiple ML models** for better accuracy  
✅ Data preprocessing and feature engineering for improved performance  

## 📊 Sample Predictions
✅ If input values suggest a high risk, the model predicts "Disease Detected" ⚠️
✅ If input values suggest low risk, the model predicts "No Disease Detected" ✅

## 📌 Future Enhancements
🚀 Improve prediction accuracy with deep learning models
📊 Add more diseases for prediction
💡 Optimize the UI for a better user experience
