# Multiple-disease-prediction-using-ML
Multiple Disease Prediction is a machine learning-based approach that helps in predicting multiple diseases such as heart disease and diabetes using patient health data. It involves collecting relevant medical parameters (e.g., blood pressure, glucose levels, BMI, cholesterol) and training models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks to classify disease risk.

By leveraging AI techniques, this system enhances early detection, enabling timely medical intervention. It is particularly useful for healthcare applications, telemedicine, and preventive diagnostics, providing a cost-effective and scalable solution for disease prediction.
